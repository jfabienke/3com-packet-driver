# The secret life of EtherLink III: "Parallel Tasking"

**"Parallel Tasking" was the primary development codename and technology brand for 3Com's EtherLink III family of network adapters**, according to official technical documentation and patent filings from the early 1990s. This name, which became a registered trademark, represented a significant architectural advance that enabled the 3C509 and 3C589 adapters to perform multiple network operations simultaneously - a breakthrough that helped establish their dominance in the early PC networking market.

The discovery of this codename comes from 3Com's own **EtherLink III Parallel Tasking Technical Reference** (Manual Part No. 09-0398-002B, August 1994), which explicitly identifies Parallel Tasking as both the internal development name and the core technology differentiator for the entire EtherLink III product line. The name appears consistently across technical documentation, patent filings, hardware markings, and even Linux kernel driver comments, confirming its central role in the product's development from 1988 through the mid-1990s. This technology was protected under **US Patent 5,307,459**, filed on July 28, 1992, which describes the "host indication optimization" techniques that made concurrent network operations possible.

## From engineering concept to market dominance

The Parallel Tasking architecture represented a fundamental shift in network adapter design during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Unlike previous sequential designs that could only handle one operation at a time, **Parallel Tasking enabled the EtherLink III cards to simultaneously process transmit and receive operations while managing host interface communications**. This concurrent processing capability dramatically improved network performance and reduced CPU overhead, making the 3C509 and its variants the gold standard for PC networking in the early 1990s.

The development timeline reveals that 3Com worked on the Parallel Tasking technology from approximately 1988 to 1992, when the first 3C509 adapters reached the market. The improved 3C509B, introduced in 1994, featured enhanced Parallel Tasking capabilities including full-duplex support. **This technology was consistently applied across the entire EtherLink III family**: the 3C509 and 3C509B for ISA systems, the 3C579 for EISA buses, the 3C529 for IBM's Micro Channel Architecture, and the 3C589 series for PCMCIA laptop cards. All these variants carried the Parallel Tasking designation in their technical specifications and chip markings.

The hardware itself bears witness to this naming convention. Controller chips were marked with designations like **40-0130-002 and 40-0130-003**, explicitly labeled as Parallel Tasking components. The main Ethernet controller ASICs were internally designated as 9513S and 9545S variants. Even the FCC regulatory filings (FCC ID: DF63C509B) reference the Parallel Tasking technology in their technical specifications, demonstrating that this wasn't merely an informal engineering nickname but an official product designation.

## Weather patterns in silicon valley

While Parallel Tasking stands as the confirmed codename for the EtherLink III family, research reveals that **3Com later adopted a systematic weather-themed naming convention for their PCI-era network adapters**. This pattern emerged in the mid-1990s, after the original EtherLink III development, and included colorful codenames like "Vortex" for the Fast EtherLink III PCI series (3C590/3C595), "Boomerang" for the EtherLink XL (3C900/3C905), "Cyclone" for the 3C905B series, "Hurricane" for the 3C555 series, and "Tornado" for the 3C905C series.

These weather-themed codenames served a practical purpose beyond mere creativity. As noted in Linux kernel documentation, **the internal names helped engineers avoid confusion with frequently mistyped product numbers** - even experienced developers would accidentally refer to the 3c509 when they meant 3c905. The systematic naming scheme provided clarity in technical discussions and driver development, a practice that became embedded in open-source driver code where these codenames remain visible today.

The adoption of weather-themed codenames appears to coincide with 3Com's transition to PCI-based products and may reflect a cultural shift within the company's engineering organization. The original EtherLink III family, developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, predated this systematic approach, suggesting that **Parallel Tasking may have been one of the last descriptive technical codenames before 3Com embraced more creative naming conventions**.

## The technical innovations behind the name

The Parallel Tasking codename wasn't merely marketing terminology but described specific technical innovations that set the EtherLink III apart from competitors. The architecture included several subsystems with their own development terminology: **RX Early Threshold for early receive indication, TX Available Threshold for transmit buffer management, TX Start Threshold for transmission optimization, and Length-Left Threshold for end-of-packet prediction**. These threshold logic systems enabled the adapter to make intelligent decisions about when to interrupt the host processor, dramatically reducing system overhead.

The technology also featured what 3Com called "look-ahead threshold logic" for predictive packet processing and "transfer complete indication" for host optimization. These capabilities were revolutionary for their time, allowing the EtherLink III to achieve performance levels that competitors couldn't match. **The Command-in-Progress state management system allowed the adapter to queue multiple operations**, living up to the Parallel Tasking name by truly processing multiple tasks simultaneously.

Patent documentation reveals that engineers W. Paul Sherer and David R. Brown were among the key inventors of these optimization techniques. Their work on reducing host processor latency through early indication signals and threshold-based interrupts became the foundation for the EtherLink III's market success. The patent's priority date of July 28, 1992, aligns with the product's market introduction, suggesting that **3Com was still refining and protecting the Parallel Tasking technology even as the first units shipped to customers**.

## Conclusion: One name to rule them all

The research definitively establishes that **"Parallel Tasking" was the primary development codename and internal project name for the 3Com EtherLink III family**, used consistently from development through production and into technical documentation. Unlike the creative weather-themed codenames of later PCI products, Parallel Tasking was a descriptive technical term that accurately captured the revolutionary concurrent processing capabilities that made these adapters successful.

This codename represents more than just internal nomenclature - it embodies a pivotal moment in networking history when 3Com's engineering team fundamentally reimagined how network adapters could operate. The Parallel Tasking architecture's influence extended far beyond the EtherLink III family, establishing design principles that would influence network adapter development for years to come. While 3Com would later embrace more whimsical codenames like Vortex and Hurricane, **Parallel Tasking stands as a testament to an era when codenames directly described the technical innovations they represented**, making it perhaps the most meaningful internal project name in 3Com's storied history.
