## Architecture Highlights

### Memory Efficiency
- **Target**: ≤5KB resident memory after cold section discard
- **Implementation**: Hot/cold separation with initialization code in discardable section
- **Integration**: DMA-safe buffer pools using memory management API

### Performance Optimization
- **CPU Detection**: Runtime optimization selection (286-Pentium)

## Week 1 Testing Strategy

Per emulator-testing.md GPT-5 recommendation:

1. **Primary**: NE2000 emulation in QEMU for CI validation
2. **Focus**: Module ABI compliance, timing constraints, memory management
3. **Validation**: Packet loopback, ISR timing, memory reduction
4. **Deferral**: Hardware-specific features to Week 2+ real hardware testing

## Performance Metrics

### Timing Validation
- **ISR Execution**: ≤60μs (measured via PIT timing framework)
- **CLI Sections**: ≤8μs (protected critical sections)
- **Module Init**: ≤100ms (cold section operations)

### Memory Efficiency  
- **Total Size**: 5KB (320 paragraphs)
- **Resident**: 4KB (256 paragraphs) 
- **Cold**: 1KB (64 paragraphs, discarded)
- **BSS**: 256 bytes (16 paragraphs)

### Integration Status
- ✅ Module ABI v0.9 compliance (64-byte header)
- ✅ Memory Management API integration
- ✅ Performance framework timing measurement  
- ✅ Shared resource usage (calling conventions, error codes)
- ✅ CI pipeline compatibility
