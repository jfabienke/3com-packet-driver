- Try PERF_PRECISION_LOW for basic timing
- Verify BIOS timer interrupt functionality

**Low throughput in virtual environments**
- Expected behavior in DOSBox/VirtualBox
- Real hardware shows significantly better performance

### Stress Testing Safety

**System hang during stress tests**
- Use graduated stress levels (light → moderate → heavy)
- Monitor system temperature and resources
- Implement safety timeouts and limits

## Test Development

### Adding New Tests

1. **Choose appropriate category** (unit/integration/performance/stress)
2. **Follow existing patterns** from similar test files
3. **Include comprehensive error handling**
4. **Add performance measurements where applicable**
5. **Update Makefile** to include new test
6. **Document test scenarios** and expected results

### Performance Test Guidelines

#### Statistical Requirements

- **Outlier detection** and proper handling
- **Baseline comparison** for regression detection

#### Measurement Best Practices
- **Consistent system state** before measurements
- **Environmental factor** consideration
- **Timer precision** appropriate for test duration
- **Statistical significance** validation

### Stress Test Guidelines

#### Safety Requirements
