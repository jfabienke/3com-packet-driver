- **Real Mode Driver Interface**
  - Windows 3.1 Real Mode operation support
  - TSR-based NDIS driver implementation
  - Interrupt sharing with Windows kernel
  - Memory management coordination with Windows

- **Enhanced Mode Support**
  - Windows 3.1 Enhanced Mode (386 Enhanced) compatibility
  - Virtual machine environment adaptation
  - Protected mode interface development
  - VxD (Virtual Device Driver) wrapper consideration

- **Dual-Mode Operation**
  - Simultaneous DOS packet driver and NDIS operation
  - Shared hardware resource management
  - Configuration switching between modes
  - Performance optimization for dual operation

#### Windows Integration Features
