## Current Architecture Status (Canonical)

The driver uses a **unified .EXE architecture** with:
- Single executable with hot/cold code separation
- â‰ˆ6.9 KB resident memory footprint after initialization (map-enforced)
- HAL vtable-based hardware abstraction
- Support for 3C509B (ISA) and 3C515-TX (PCI) NICs
- Three-tier memory management (Conventional/UMB/XMS)

## Quick Reference

For understanding the current implementation:
1. Start with **03-overview.md** for the big picture
2. Review **05-unified-architecture.md** for detailed design
3. Check **06-vtable-hal.md** for hardware abstraction
4. Consult **10-memory-model.md** for memory management
