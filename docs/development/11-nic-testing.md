/* Configure MAC address */
uint8_t mac[] = {0x00, 0x60, 0x8C, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56};
mock_device_set_mac_address(device_id, mac);

/* Configure link status */
mock_device_set_link_status(device_id, true, 10);

/* Inject error for testing */
mock_error_inject(device_id, MOCK_ERROR_ADAPTER_FAILURE, 5);
```

4. **Hardware Dependencies**: Ensure tests don't require actual hardware

### Debug Options

Enable detailed debugging:

```bash
# Enable all debug logging
./nic_driver_test_runner -verbose

# Enable I/O operation logging
mock_io_log_enable(true);

# Dump device state for debugging
mock_dump_device_state(device_id);
```

### Performance Analysis

Monitor test performance:

```c
/* Get mock framework statistics */
mock_statistics_t stats;
mock_get_statistics(&stats);

/* Analyze I/O operation patterns */
mock_io_log_entry_t log[100];
int count = mock_io_log_get_entries(log, 100);
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The test suite is designed for automated testing:

```bash
# Return codes
# 0: All tests passed
# 1: Some tests failed

# Suitable for automated builds
make -C tests/unit all
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "All unit tests passed"
else
    echo "Unit tests failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Add test function to appropriate test file
2. Update test runner to include new test
3. Update documentation with new test description
4. Ensure proper cleanup and error handling

### Updating Hardware Simulation

1. Modify mock framework for new hardware features
2. Update existing tests to use new features
