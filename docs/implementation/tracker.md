### Week 5: Module Consolidation
**Target**: 18KB ‚Üí 15KB (17% reduction)  
**Status**: NOT STARTED

#### Consolidation Plan
- [ ] Merge PTASK and CORKSCRW wrappers (save ~3KB)
- [ ] Unify ISR handlers (save ~1KB)
- [ ] Share common assembly routines (save ~1KB)
- [ ] Eliminate vtable overhead where possible
- [ ] Create single unified binary

## Risk Tracking

### High Priority Risks
1. **No Testing Capability**: Cannot verify optimizations work
   - Mitigation: Keep backup of working binary
   
2. **Breaking Changes**: Optimizations might break functionality
   - Mitigation: Make incremental changes with Git tags

3. **Performance Impact**: Size optimizations might slow code
   - Mitigation: Profile critical paths before/after

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Watcom Compiler Limitations**: May not support all optimizations
2. **Assembly Complexity**: Hand optimization is error-prone
3. **Time Constraints**: 5 weeks may be ambitious

## Historical Context (For Reference Only)

### Previous Claims (NOT ACCURATE)
The previous documentation claimed:
- "14 agents deployed" - Never happened
- "Week 1 gates approved" - No gates existed
- "87/100 quality score" - No scoring system
- "QEMU validation" - QEMU doesn't support 3Com

These were aspirational goals, not actual achievements.

### What Actually Happened
1. Basic driver implementation completed
2. Module wrappers created for PTASK/CORKSCRW
3. API implementation finished
4. Size became obvious problem (~55KB too large)
5. NE2000 compatibility attempted then removed
6. Test infrastructure built then removed (no hardware)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. [ ] Create size measurement baseline
2. [ ] Set up optimized build configuration
3. [ ] Identify largest code sections
4. [ ] Tag current working version in Git

### Week 1 Preparation
1. [ ] Install Watcom analysis tools
2. [ ] Create size tracking spreadsheet
3. [ ] Review assembly files for obvious optimizations
4. [ ] Document current memory layout

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Required)
- Final size ‚â§ 16KB resident
- All current functionality preserved
- No performance regression

### Should Have (Desired)
- Final size ‚â§ 14KB resident
- 10% performance improvement
- Clean modular structure

### Could Have (Stretch)
- Final size ‚â§ 13KB resident
- 25% performance improvement
- Hot-swappable modules

## Notes

### Reality Check
This tracker reflects what actually exists, not what was planned. The previous tracker had ambitious claims about "Phase 5 completion" and "14 agents" that never materialized. This document tracks real, measurable progress on size optimization.

### No Hardware = No Testing
Without physical 3Com NICs or emulator support, we cannot test changes. Every optimization must be carefully considered since we can't verify functionality. The focus is on preserving the working code while reducing size.

### Pragmatic Approach
Rather than a complete rewrite (21 weeks), we're doing targeted optimization (5 weeks). This is achievable and focused on the actual problem: the driver works but is too large.
