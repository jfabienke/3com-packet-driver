## Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
Since we've exceeded our memory target by 2KB (13KB vs 15KB goal), no immediate action required.

### Future Enhancements (If Needed)
1. **Further Size Reduction** (if <13KB required):
   - Implement overlay system (Week 5 plan)
   - Move to minimal core + hardware overlays
   - Potential: 8KB core + 5KB per NIC

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile hot paths with cycle counting
   - Optimize critical loops further
   - Consider unrolling key operations

3. **Feature Additions** (space permitting):
   - Advanced statistics collection
   - Enhanced diagnostic mode
   - Extended multicast support

## Communication Log

### Key Decisions
- **Week 3**: Chose SMC over maintaining runtime CPU detection
- **Week 3**: Integrated existing DMA/cache code rather than rewrite
- **Week 3**: Used 5-byte NOP sleds for safety over smaller patches
- **Week 3**: GPT-5 review led to 7 critical fixes

### Stakeholder Updates
- Phase 1: Quick wins completed, 18% reduction achieved
- Phase 2: Cold/hot separation successful, 33% reduction
- Phase 3: SMC implementation exceeded all targets, 76% total reduction
- **Current**: Production ready, 13KB resident, GPT-5 validated
