- Documentation can be developed alongside implementation
- Test suite development can proceed in parallel with features
- Hardware research can overlap with implementation phases

### Total Project Duration: 16-20 weeks (updated for comprehensive Phase 3B enterprise features)

**Immediate Next Step:** Begin Sprint 0A (Complete 3c509 Family Support) with media type detection framework.

This implementation plan provides a realistic, structured approach to achieving production-quality DOS networking while leveraging proven Linux techniques and maintaining our unique DOS optimizations.
