// Single module supporting multiple chip generations
static const nic_family_t boomtex_families[] = {
    { 0x10B7, 0x5900, VORTEX_GENERATION },   // 3C590/595
    { 0x10B7, 0x9000, BOOMERANG_GENERATION }, // 3C900/905  
    { 0x10B7, 0x9050, CYCLONE_GENERATION },   // 3C905B series
    { 0x10B7, 0x9200, TORNADO_GENERATION },   // 3C905C series
    // ... 42 total supported devices
};
```

#### Generic Bus Services
Reusable across hardware families:
```c
// Bus-independent service interfaces
typedef struct {
    bool (*config_read)(bus_address_t addr, void* data, size_t len);
    bool (*config_write)(bus_address_t addr, void* data, size_t len);  
    bool (*memory_map)(bus_address_t addr, void** mapped_ptr);
} bus_services_t;

// Implementations: pci_bus_services, cardbus_services, pcmcia_services
```

#### Enterprise Feature Framework
Capability-driven feature loading:
```c
// Automatic feature detection and loading
if (nic_capabilities & CAP_WAKE_ON_LAN) {
    load_module("WOL.MOD");
}
if (enterprise_environment_detected()) {
    load_module("VLAN.MOD");
    load_module("ANSIUI.MOD");

## üèÜ **FINAL PROJECT ACHIEVEMENT SUMMARY**

### **DOS-Specific Technical Mastery**
Our implementation addresses the unique challenges of DOS packet drivers:

**Cache Management Strategy:**
- **386+**: Direct MOV EAX, CR0 instruction for reliable cache state detection
