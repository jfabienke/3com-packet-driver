## Risk Management and Contingencies

### High-Risk Task Mitigation

#### Critical Path Risks
```
Risk: API specification delays
Mitigation: Pre-draft specs during design phase
Contingency: 4-hour emergency API workshop

Risk: Core loader integration issues
Mitigation: Daily integration testing starting Day 3
Contingency: Rollback to previous working version

Risk: Hardware module complexity
Mitigation: Senior developers on hardware teams
Contingency: Reduce module scope to essential features
```

#### Resource Allocation Flexibility
```
If Stream 1 (Core) behind: Reallocate from Stream 4
If Stream 2 (Hardware) behind: Reallocate from Stream 3
If Stream 3 (Features) behind: Defer DIAG.MOD to post-MVP
If Stream 4 (Infrastructure) behind: Manual processes temporarily
```
