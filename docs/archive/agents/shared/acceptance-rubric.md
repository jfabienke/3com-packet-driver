## Scoring Scale

### Overall Deliverable Quality

## Special Criteria by Agent Type

### Core Infrastructure Agents (01-04)
**Additional Requirements**:
- Must achieve "Excellent" in Architecture Compliance (≥22/25 points)
- Foundation deliverables require 95+ overall score for other agents to proceed
- Interface specifications must be complete and frozen by deadline

### NIC Implementation Agents (05-10)
**Additional Requirements**:
- Must achieve "Good" or better in Performance & Optimization (≥16/20 points)
- Hardware programming must achieve "Excellent" (5/5 points)
- Emulator testing must pass without exceptions

### Service Agents (11-14)

## Week 1 Gate Criteria

### Minimum Acceptance Thresholds
All Week 1 deliverables must meet these minimum requirements:

#### Technical Minimums
- [ ] DOS/x86 compliance ≥10/15 points (no critical real-mode errors)
- [ ] Interrupt safety ≥7/10 points (no system stability issues)
- [ ] Module ABI compliance ≥7/10 points (interfaces work correctly)

#### Integration Minimums
- [ ] Builds successfully in CI pipeline
- [ ] Loads in QEMU emulator without errors
- [ ] Passes basic smoke tests
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable range of targets

#### Process Minimums
- [ ] All deliverable files created at specified paths
- [ ] Documentation sufficient for other agents to consume
- [ ] Questions and assumptions clearly documented
- [ ] Next steps defined for Week 2

## Evaluation Process

### Self-Assessment
Each agent must provide self-assessment against this rubric with their deliverables:
```markdown
## Self-Assessment Summary
**Overall Score**: [X]/100
**Confidence Level**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Category Scores**:
- Technical Correctness: [X]/40
- Architecture Compliance: [X]/25  
- Performance & Optimization: [X]/20
- Testing & Validation: [X]/10
- Documentation & Quality: [X]/5

**Areas of Concern**: [List any areas below target]
**Improvement Plan**: [Steps to address concerns]
```

### Peer Review
Critical deliverables require peer review from related agents:
- **Module ABI**: Reviewed by all NIC implementation agents
- **Build System**: Reviewed by all implementation agents
- **NIC Modules**: Cross-reviewed by other NIC teams

### Integration Review
Integration & QA agent (14) conducts final review before Week 1 gate approval.

## Remediation Process

### Below Threshold Performance
If any deliverable scores below minimum thresholds:

1. **Immediate Notification**: Agent and Integration & QA notified within 24 hours
2. **Remediation Plan**: Agent provides specific fix plan with timeline
3. **Priority Support**: Other agents provide assistance if deliverable blocks dependencies
4. **Re-evaluation**: Updated deliverable re-assessed within 48 hours

### Gate Blocking Issues
If critical path deliverables fail to meet Week 1 gates:

1. **Escalation**: Issue escalated to project leadership immediately
2. **Resource Reallocation**: Additional agents assigned if needed
3. **Scope Adjustment**: Non-critical features deferred if necessary
4. **Timeline Impact**: Week 2 tasks adjusted based on gate completion

## Quality Improvement

### Continuous Improvement
- Rubric updated based on evaluation experience
- Common failure patterns addressed in agent prompts
- Best practices documented and shared across agents

### Success Metrics Tracking
- Average deliverable scores by agent type
- Time to remediation for below-threshold deliverables
- Gate completion percentage and timeline impact

**Usage**: This rubric must be applied consistently by all agents for self-assessment and by Integration & QA for final validation. Scores must be documented and tracked for project quality metrics.
