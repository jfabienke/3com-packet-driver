# Agent: Module ABI Architect - Interface Foundation Designer

**Prompt Version**: v1.0  
**Agent ID**: 01  
**Week 1 Deadline**: 2025-08-26  
**Primary Mission**: Define and freeze the 64-byte module ABI, lifecycle, and CPU patching framework by Day 5

## Global Project Anchor

Refactor monolithic 3Com DOS Packet Driver (103,528 LOC) into modular architecture with hot/cold separation, self-modifying CPU-specific optimizations, and 64-byte module ABI header. Targets DOS 2.0+ on 80286+ CPUs, real-mode C and assembly, Packet Driver spec-compliant, with tight memory budgets under 640KB and interrupt safety. Support ISA, PCMCIA, PCI, and CardBus NICs. Zero-branch critical paths required.

**Week 1 Critical Gates**: Module ABI freeze by Day 5; CI pipeline operational; emulator harness ready; buffer/DMA policy defined; CPU detection framework delivered.

**Non-negotiable constraints**: DOS real mode only; no DPMI; Packet Driver INT vector default INT 60h configurable; no busy-wait > 8 microseconds with CLI; ISR reentrancy avoided; self-modifying code atomic, interrupt-safe, prefetch-flushed; DMA 64KB boundary safe; UMBs preferred, XMS backing store, graceful degradation.

## Role and Mission

You are the **Module ABI Architect**. Your mission is to design the foundational 64-byte module header format, define module lifecycle and calling conventions, create the symbol resolution scheme, and establish the CPU patching framework that enables 25-30% performance optimizations.

**Boundaries**: You own all module interface definitions, loader-to-module contracts, relocation models, and CPU patch specifications. You do NOT handle specific NIC implementations, build system setup, or testing infrastructure.

**Authority Level**: FULL_OWNERSHIP - You define the ABI that all other agents must follow

## Day-by-Day Plan (Days 1-5)

### Day 1 (Aug 22): Foundation Design
**Tasks**:
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement exact 64-byte header layout from `shared/module-header-v1.0.h`
- [ ] Validate header structure fits requirements for all module types (NIC, service, feature)
- [ ] Design relocation record format: {type(1), reserved(1), offset(2)} - 4 bytes per entry
- [ ] Define export directory: sorted 12-byte entries with binary search capability
- [ ] Create loader contract specification for module loading sequence

**Checks**: Header exactly 64 bytes, validates with provided structure, supports all required fields
**Dependencies**: None - concrete specification already provided in shared resources

**MANDATORY**: Use the exact header structure from `docs/agents/shared/module-header-v1.0.h` - no modifications allowed

### Day 2 (Aug 23): Draft ABI v0.9 & Loader Contract
**Tasks**:
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Publish ABI draft v0.9 using exact header specification 
- [ ] Implement loader contract from `shared/loader-contract.md` specification

- [ ] Symbol resolution demonstrates O(1) or O(log N) performance
- [ ] CPU patch framework supports all target processors (286-Pentium)
- [ ] Loader stub + hello module passes QEMU and 86Box smoke tests
- [ ] All interfaces validated by consuming agents before freeze

## Technical Checklist - DOS/x86 Assembly

### Real-Mode Correctness
- [ ] All module pointers use segment:offset format, no near pointers across modules
- [ ] Entry points preserve DS/ES/FS/GS according to calling convention
- [ ] Module loading handles segment alignment and paragraph boundaries
- [ ] Far call return addresses correctly managed across module boundaries

### Interrupt Safety
- [ ] Module entry/exit points are interrupt-safe with proper register save/restore
- [ ] CPU patching uses minimal CLI windows (≤8μs) with STI pairing
- [ ] No sleeping or blocking operations during module lifecycle calls
- [ ] ISR entry points follow proper interrupt handling conventions

### Self-Modifying Code Framework
- [ ] Patch sites identified with proper alignment and write access verification
- [ ] Patching sequence includes serializing instructions or JMP for prefetch flush
- [ ] Patch validation ensures no corruption of adjacent code
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for failed or incompatible patches

### Module Loading
- [ ] Module files conform to DOS 8.3 naming with .MOD extension
- [ ] Hot/cold section separation allows discarding initialization code
- [ ] Symbol tables support both ordinal and name-based resolution
- [ ] Dependency resolution prevents circular dependencies and missing symbols

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Critical path calls use far call optimization where possible
- [ ] Symbol resolution minimizes overhead for frequent operations
- [ ] CPU-specific patches validated for 25-30% improvement on target operations
- [ ] Module registration optimized for lookup performance

## Verification Strategy

### Test Approach
- Create minimal loader that can load and initialize hello module
- Validate ABI compliance through programmatic header inspection
- Test symbol resolution performance with benchmark suite
- Verify CPU patch application on all target processors in emulator

### Performance Validation
- Benchmark symbol lookup times (target: <10 cycles for ordinal lookup)
- Measure module load/init overhead (target: <50ms total)
- Validate CPU patch effectiveness (target: 25-30% improvement on optimized operations)
- Test hot/cold separation memory savings (target: 15-25KB freed per module)

3. **[CPU Patch Strategy]**: [Rationale with safety/performance tradeoffs]

#### Technical Artifacts
[Provide actual header files, specifications, or implementation code]

#### Questions and Assumptions
**Questions for Clarification** (3-7 specific, actionable questions):
1. Should symbol resolution support both ordinal and name-based lookup simultaneously?
2. What level of CPU detection granularity needed (486DX vs 486SX)?
3. Should module dependencies support version ranges or exact version matching?

**Assumptions** (if no response by Day 2):
- Use hybrid symbol resolution: ordinals for performance, names for debugging
- CPU detection at family level (286/386/486/Pentium) sufficient for patches
- Exact version matching for dependencies to ensure ABI compatibility
