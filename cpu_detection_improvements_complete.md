# CPU Detection Module - Production-Ready Improvements

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED ✅

Based on GPT-5's comprehensive review (Grade: A-, with Assembly B+ and C Module A-), all critical improvements have been successfully implemented to elevate the code to production quality.

## Critical Improvements Implemented

### 1. RDTSC Serialization with CPUID Fences ✅
**Problem**: RDTSC without serialization allowed out-of-order execution, skewing measurements
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added CPUID (EAX=0) serialization barriers before and after RDTSC
- Prevents instruction reordering on Pentium+ CPUs
- Uses proper opcodes (0F A2h for CPUID, 0F 31h for RDTSC)

```asm
; CPUID serialization fence before RDTSC
mov     eax, 0
db      0fh, 0a2h       ; CPUID instruction - serializes execution

; Read RDTSC start
db      0fh, 31h        ; RDTSC instruction
mov     dword ptr [rdtsc_start_low], eax
mov     dword ptr [rdtsc_start_high], edx

; ... timing loop ...

; CPUID serialization fence before second RDTSC
mov     eax, 0
db      0fh, 0a2h       ; CPUID instruction - serializes execution

; Read RDTSC end
db      0fh, 31h        ; RDTSC instruction
```

### 2. PIT Channel 2 Safety ✅
**Problem**: Channel 0 disrupts DOS system timer, risking system instability
**Solution Implemented**:
- Switched from PIT channel 0 to channel 2 (speaker timer)
- Saves/restores port 61h state properly
- Uses ports 42h instead of 40h for counter access
- Prevents DOS tick interruption

```asm
; Save port 61h state (speaker control)
in      al, 61h
mov     byte ptr [port_61h_state], al
and     al, 0FCh        ; Disable speaker
or      al, 01h         ; Enable timer 2 gate
out     61h, al

; Program PIT channel 2 for one-shot mode
mov     al, 0B0h        ; Channel 2, LSB/MSB, mode 0
out     43h, al
```

### 3. Loop Overhead Calibration ✅
**Problem**: Fixed cycle assumptions inaccurate across CPU variants
**Solution Implemented**:
- Measures empty loop overhead separately
- Subtracts overhead from main measurement
- Accounts for LOOP instruction variability (5-17 cycles)

```asm
calibrate_loop_overhead PROC
    ; Empty loop (just the loop instruction)
    mov     cx, 10000
.overhead_loop:
    loop    .overhead_loop
    ; Store overhead for later subtraction
    mov     word ptr [loop_overhead_ticks], bx
```

### 4. Multi-Trial Statistical Robustness ✅
**Problem**: Single measurements vulnerable to interrupts and outliers
**Solution Implemented**:
- Performs 5 independent speed measurements
- Sorts results using bubble sort
- Selects median (3rd of 5 values)
- Calculates confidence based on variance

```asm
; Perform multiple trials for statistical robustness
mov     di, 5           ; 5 trials
mov     si, OFFSET speed_trials

.trial_loop:
    call    single_speed_trial
    mov     [si], ax        ; Store result
    add     si, 2
    dec     di
    jnz     .trial_loop

; Sort trials and pick median
call    sort_speed_trials
mov     ax, word ptr [speed_trials+4]  ; 3rd of 5 sorted values (median)
```

### 5. Confidence Metric ✅
**Problem**: No quality indication for measurements
**Solution Implemented**:
- Calculates variance as (max - min) of trials
- Converts to confidence percentage (0-100%)
- High confidence (100%) if variance ≤ 5 MHz
- Low confidence (0%) if variance > 50 MHz
- Linear scale between

```asm
calculate_confidence PROC
    ; Calculate variance as (max - min)
    mov     ax, word ptr [speed_trials+8]  ; Max (5th element)
    sub     ax, word ptr [speed_trials]    ; Min (1st element)
    
    ; Convert variance to confidence
    ; If variance <= 5 MHz, confidence = 100%
    ; If variance > 50 MHz, confidence = 0%
    cmp     ax, 5
    jbe     .high_confidence
    cmp     ax, 50
    jae     .low_confidence
    
    ; Linear scale: confidence = 100 - (variance * 2)
    shl     ax, 1           ; variance * 2
    mov     bx, 100
    sub     bx, ax
```

### 6. Vendor-Specific Adjustments Removed ✅
**Problem**: Hardcoded percentage adjustments (AMD +3%, Cyrix -5%) were "red flags"
**Solution**: Removed all vendor-specific fudge factors - proper measurement is more accurate

### 7. Extended CPUID Cache Detection ✅
**Problem**: Limited cache detection on AMD/VIA processors
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added support for CPUID leaves 0x80000005/0x80000006
- Detects L1D, L1I, L2 cache sizes on AMD K5/K6+
- Properly handles VIA C3 and other extended CPUID processors

```asm
get_extended_cache_info PROC
    ; Check if extended CPUID is available
    mov     eax, 80000000h
    cpuid
    cmp     eax, 80000006h  ; Need at least 0x80000006
    jb      .done
    
    ; Get L1 cache information (leaf 0x80000005)
    mov     eax, 80000005h
    cpuid
    ; ECX = L1 data cache, EDX = L1 instruction cache
    
    ; Get L2 cache information (leaf 0x80000006)
    mov     eax, 80000006h
    cpuid
    ; ECX bits 31-16 = L2 size in KB
```

## C Module Updates ✅

### Added Confidence Field
```c
typedef struct {
    // ... existing fields
    uint8_t speed_confidence;  /* Speed measurement confidence (0-100%) */
} cpu_info_t;
```

### Updated Logging
```c
LOG_INFO("CPU speed: ~%d MHz (confidence: %d%%)", 
         g_cpu_info.cpu_mhz, g_cpu_info.speed_confidence);
```

### Confidence-Based Fallback
```c
/* If confidence is very low or speed is invalid, use fallback */
if (info->speed_confidence < 25 || info->cpu_mhz == 0) {
    /* Apply CPU type-based defaults */
}
```
